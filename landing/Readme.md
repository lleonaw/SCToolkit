## vis\_config.py

Python script that can be used to startup Visit in a civilized manner. It will use the last touched \*.nek5000 database by default, add a reasonable selection of pseudocolor plots along with the quadrature grids and element grids. Usage example:

`visit -nosplash -s /path/to/vis_config.py`
